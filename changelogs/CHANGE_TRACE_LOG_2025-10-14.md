# Change Trace Log - 2025-10-14

**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Phase:** Testing Period - Week 1, Day 1  
**Focus:** Initial functional testing of Phases 3.3-3.8 implementation

---

## Session 1: Initial Functional Testing (12:00-12:20)

### Objective
Test all newly implemented functionality (Phases 3.3-3.8) to verify correctness before proceeding with extended testing period.

### Activities

#### 1. Test Script Creation
**File:** `research/notebooks/03_analysis_new_features.py`

**Purpose:**
Comprehensive functional testing of new features using NotebookSimulator pattern.

**Structure (10 steps):**
1. Data preparation & zone detection
2. Time metrics testing (Phase 3.3)
3. Swing strategies comparison (Phase 3.1)
4. Divergence detection (Phase 3.4)
5. Volatility analysis (Phase 3.5)
6. Volume analysis (Phase 3.6)
7. Hypothesis tests (Phase 3.7: H4, ADF, H5)
8. Regression analysis (Phase 3.8)
9. Validation suite (Phase 3.8)
10. Summary and conclusions

**Key features:**
- Uses built-in sample data (`tv_xauusd_1h`, 1000 bars)
- Tests all 8 strategies
- Validates all 67 metrics
- Demonstrates real-world use cases (adaptive position sizing)

---

#### 2. Script Development & Debugging

**Initial issues fixed:**
- Strategy registration: Added explicit imports for all 7 strategies
- Strategy instantiation: Changed from string names to objects
- Metrics access: Added dict/object compatibility checks
- Hypothesis tests: Convert ZoneFeatures to dicts with `asdict()`
- Field mapping: Added 'type' field from 'zone_type'
- RegressionResult: Use `metadata` instead of `diagnostics`
- ValidationSuite: Corrected API (analyze_func + DataFrame, not features list)

**Iterations:** 7 attempts to fix all issues

#### Issues & Limitations ⚠️

1. **Return model weak** (R²=0.107)
   - Current predictors insufficient
   - Price returns harder to model than duration
   - Need feature engineering or alternative approach

5. **Bollinger metrics warnings**
   - "list index out of range" errors
   - Graceful degradation works but needs investigation
